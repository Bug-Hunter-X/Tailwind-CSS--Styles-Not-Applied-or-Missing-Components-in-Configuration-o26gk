# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components or entire components missing because the `content` property in the Tailwind configuration file is not correctly specifying the locations of all your project's components.  The issue occurs when you have components in unexpected locations not directly in `src/` directory.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` demonstrates a Tailwind configuration that only includes `./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` in the `content` array. This means Tailwind won't process files outside this directory structure, leading to missing styles.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` shows a corrected Tailwind configuration.  By adjusting the `content` array to correctly include all relevant folders, all components and their styles will be picked up by Tailwind.
